# Apple Silicon

The easiest way to follow along with the book is to use `Parallels Pro`. This is a paid software solution, but it will work with `vagrant` and `minikube`.

> If you do not want to pay for Parallels, you can do something similar with QEMU but will require more setup

## Getting Started

The first thing you need to do is make sure you have `vagrant`, `ansible` installed. From a terminal, enter the following:

```bash
brew install ansible vagrant
```

Then, you'll need to install the `vagrant-parallels` plugin.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels
```

Once that is installed, make sure you are in `apple-silicon/vagrant/` directory before running the `vagrant up` command like we do in Chapter 1:

> Make sure you add `--provider=parallels` to the command

```vagrant
$ vagrant up --provider=parallels

PLAY [Provision VM] ************************************************************

```

__Please note, Vagrant and Parallels use the default SSH port (22) and the IP address of the VM instead of `localhost` and port 2222.__

To get the IP of the VM you can enter the following in a terminal:

```
vagrant ssh-config
Host default
  HostName 10.211.55.20
  User vagrant
  Port 22
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /Users/bradleydsmith/Projects/devops_for_the_desperate/apple-silicon/vagrant/.vagrant/machines/default/parallels/private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
```

Grab `HostName` IP, 10.211.55.20 in my case, and use that in any of the books text where it ask you to ssh in.
You can also use this IP when the book references accessing the public IP of the VM too.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/dftd bender@<VM IP> 

```

You are now ready to follow along on the book as you were on a Linux or Intel-based Mac.
